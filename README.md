# Goods project.
I'm an obsessive compulsive and I like to make things good. I buy way too much stuff and I don't want to waste it. So I decided to make a good project. This is a project where I can add stuff I buy for my own use. For my office. To see how much money I actually waste.

Was thinking I could put this on a website, enable account creation amd then make people able to do this stuff for free, consolidated.. I don't know. But for now, it's free here on GitHub for you all to use on your own servers/hosting.

One rule. It needs to be on a subdomain called "goods".
IE: https://goods.example.com

## Usage
Build the project with `npm install`.
Start the project with `npm start`.
If you're not interested in building your own project, you can just use the `build` folder and throw that on your server (after you've added you own content of course).

## Why?
Why not?

## Filter
Filter is just based of data-attributes. Very easy. Easy peacey easy.

## Search
The search is done with a simple javascript. It's not a search engine. It's just a search box. I'm not sure if I should call it a search engine or not. But it's a search box. I'm not the best at jQuery and AJAX, so take this with a grain of salt please.

## Images
If you use images with white background, the CSS will make them look like they have a no background. Good eh? *smile* No need for big PNG images.. but I guess you're one of the cool kids that uses .webp images.

## CSS
.scss with some home made mixins. Enjoy and move them to your own project if you want.
